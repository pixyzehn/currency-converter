A simple currency converter library using the XML data from [pixyzehn/getexpenses.app](https://github.com/pixyzehn/getexpenses.app) (originally from [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html)). The library has been created and used for [Expenses.app](https://getexpenses.app). It fetches the latest foreign exchange reference rates and returns the objects in a simple way.
